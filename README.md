# Cogs

## Deepfry
This cog lets you deepfry and nuke images. It has a 1/10 chance to deepfry any image posted automaticly and users can choose to deepfry or nuke images. 

Images have to be attatched to the command, links do NOT work!
### Usage
`[p]deepfry <amount>`

Deepfries the attatched image by the `amount` provided.

`[p]nuke`

Nukes the attatched image

## WordStats
This cog tracks the most commonly written words in any server the bot is in.
### Usage
`[p]wordstats <user>`

Shows the top 30 words said in any server the bot is in. Using the optional `user` argument will only show words said by that user.
