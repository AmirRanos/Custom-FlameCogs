# Contributor Guidelines

### Creating a PR
Please develop your changes on a fork of the latest version of the `dev` branch of this repo (if it exists). Doing so ensures you are editing the latest version of the code and prevents you from duplicating work. Please test your code before submitting your PR so that no new bugs are created.

### Where to merge
Please create all PRs to have the base branch be `dev`. If the branch does not exist, just pull to `master`.

### Style
This repo generally follows the PEP-8 style guide. Although it is not a major concern, please try to keep your coding style similar to the existing code, such as keeping line lengths under 100 characters where possible. Please do not create a PR formatting this repo to a different style.

### Translations
If you would like to translate a cog that does not currently support translations or if you need help understanding how to create a translation, please [contact Flame](https://discord.gg/bYqCjvu) before creating a PR.
